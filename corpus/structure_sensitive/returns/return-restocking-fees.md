# Return Restocking Fee Matrix

## Purpose

This reference defines the current restocking fee for BrightCart production cases. This material is intentionally detailed because the operational decision depends on context, scope, and the exact source of truth. BrightCart teams should not copy a number from an old ticket, Slack message, or customer case without checking the current rule. The examples describe normal production behavior and distinguish permanent policy from incident-only workarounds. When

## Scope

The matrix must be read using both the row label and the column headings; a value without its heading can be misleading. This material is intentionally detailed because the operational decision depends on context, scope, and the exact source of truth. BrightCart teams should not copy a number from an old ticket, Slack message, or customer case without checking the current rule. The examples describe

## Before using the matrix

Before applying a matrix row, confirm the customer state and channel because similar scenarios can map to different actions. This material is intentionally detailed because the operational decision depends on context, scope, and the exact source of truth. BrightCart teams should not copy a number from an old ticket, Slack message, or customer case without checking the current rule. The

## Decision matrix

Use the complete table. The same number can mean a fee, a time limit, or an approval threshold depending on the column. Do not interpret a row after stripping away the header.

| Scenario | Customer state or condition | Threshold or value | Required action | Owner |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| standard case | account in good standing | $25 | follow normal workflow | Support |
| low value exception | verified repeat customer | $50 | record note and continue | Support |
| regional exception | EU customer | local rule | check regional appendix | Regional Ops |
| incident workaround | incident flag active | temporary | follow incident commander guidance | Incident Mgmt |
| business account | approved business profile | $500 | use business workflow | B2B Ops |
| guest checkout | no account history | $100 | verify order ownership | Support |
| high risk signal | velocity alert present | high | pause and review | Risk |
| manual override | manager approval attached | $750 | continue with audit note | Operations |
| legacy migration | order created before migration | legacy | consult migration mapping | Engineering |
| partner channel | authorized partner order | partner terms | apply partner contract | Partner Ops |
| tax adjustment | tax-only correction | $20 | route to tax service | Finance |
| duplicate request | same action already pending | zero | do not create duplicate | Operations |
| holiday exception | federal holiday impacts timing | next business day | shift operational clock only | Operations |
| training example | sandbox environment | not applicable | do not use for production | Training |
| opened large appliance returned for preference | item complete and returned within 30 days | 15% | deduct the restocking fee before refund | Returns Operations |

## How to interpret values

Thresholds and values are typed by their column and should never be read as standalone policy statements. This material is intentionally detailed because the operational decision depends on context, scope, and the exact source of truth. BrightCart teams should not copy a number from an old ticket, Slack message, or customer case without checking the current rule. The examples describe normal production behavior and distinguish permanent policy from incident-only workarounds.

## Worked example

A support specialist first matches the scenario and customer condition, then reads across the same row to the required action and owner. This material is intentionally detailed because the operational decision depends on context, scope, and the exact source of truth. BrightCart teams should not copy a number from an old ticket, Slack message, or customer case without checking the current rule. The examples describe normal production behavior and distinguish permanent policy from incident-only workarounds.

## Exceptions

If two rows appear applicable, use the more specific row and escalate when the outcomes conflict. This material is intentionally detailed because the operational decision depends on context, scope, and the exact source of truth. BrightCart teams should not copy a number from an old ticket, Slack message, or customer case without checking the current rule. The examples describe normal production behavior and distinguish permanent policy from incident-only workarounds. When

## Escalation

Cases outside the matrix go to the named operational owner rather than being forced into the nearest numeric threshold. This material is intentionally detailed because the operational decision depends on context, scope, and the exact source of truth. BrightCart teams should not copy a number from an old ticket, Slack message, or customer case without checking the current rule. The examples describe normal production behavior and distinguish permanent policy from

## Common mistakes

The most common mistake is retrieving only a middle table row without the header, which removes the meaning of the value column. This material is intentionally detailed because the operational decision depends on context, scope, and the exact source of truth. BrightCart teams should not copy a number from an old ticket, Slack message, or customer case without checking the current rule. The examples describe normal production behavior and distinguish permanent policy from incident-only workarounds.
